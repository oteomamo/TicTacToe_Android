# TicTacToe_Android

## Description
This Android Studio project presents a modern iteration of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, offering users
a choice between two different gameplay modes showcased prominently on the home screen, alongside a
leaderboard functionality powered by SQLite technology for storing player data.

Upon launching the application, users are first guided to a player name selection page, a prerequisite step 
to personalize their gaming experience. The game modes diverge into a standard format and a blitz version. 
The blitz mode distinguishes itself by introducing an 8-second timer, enforcing a swift pace and encouraging 
quick decision-making, ultimately heightening the gaming tension as the timer counts down to zero, concluding
the game if no winner emerges in the stipulated time frame.

Post-game, a screen displaying the winner's name is prompted, providing options for users to either play again, 
view the leaderboard, or return to the main menu. The leaderboard encapsulates a list of all players along with
their respective win counts, fostering a competitive environment. Furthermore, users have the option to clear 
the database, allowing for a reset of the recorded standings, accessible via a dedicated button on the main menu.
This feature guarantees a fresh and competitive gaming atmosphere each time the database is cleared.

## Features:

This Android application leverages fragments specifically for database preview, offering a streamlined glimpse
into stored data with enhanced modularity and adaptability. Moreover, background threads have been implemented 
in a vital role within the blitz game mode, functioning as the backbone for the real-time countdown timer, 
ensuring smooth and uninterrupted gameplay. These elements, coupled with a variety of interactive activities, 
synergize to offer users a fluid and engaging gaming experience.

## Run and Test the Database
This application can be run using AndroidStudio.

## Purpose:
This project was created as the culminating assignment for the COP4656 Mobile Programming course at FSU in the Summer '23 term.
